            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ld <hi>Grecians</hi> did wisely, to put their <hi>Children</hi> to those <hi>trades,</hi> which they did most <hi>fancie:</hi> for though all men be of one nature; yet they are not all drawne with the selfe same pleasure: but some doe delight in one thing, whose contrarie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers affect. He is then wise, who can follow his particular inclination, chiefly when reason approves it, and religion is his object. I might perhaps have in my Youth, produc'd some fruits of wit, had not my Teachers hindred me, to attaine then to that knowledge, which (as they said) they did foresee, should withdraw me from them to a contrarie Religion call'd by them Heresie: for since I knew my selfe, I had alwayes a great desire, to adorne my mind with knowledge, and to commit my conceits to paper; that I
<pb facs="tcp:55440:4"/> might find them there, when my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie should lose them. Now of concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I hold those the best, which God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spires to make us good. Such I greatly esteeme, and God grant, I love them till death. Since then I am in this Countrie, in which 'tis lawfull to be good, and where goodnes is taught by examples and counsels; I think it verie convenient, to lose no occasion of aspiring unto goodnes and pietie, by the description of those thoughts, wherewith God doth daily blesse me. They may do me much good in reading them sometimes, and perhaps serve some friends, to whom I'le communicate them. Besides, my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to leave them to my Issue, for helps unto wisdome, vertue and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. I have in other books divers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for instruction: but this chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <hi>precepts</hi> for devotion, and digested Meditations upon manie subjects, which (in my opinion) may give both light un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mind, and heat unto the affections of my posteritie, I may now say of the
<pb facs="tcp:55440:4"/> publick: for sith this Book is licens'd for the presse, I hope, thousands shall find in it (besides manie points of Beliefe) such <hi>prudent rules</hi> to order their affaires, such <hi>Christian helps</hi> to raise <hi>nature</hi> above her element in her <hi>daylie operations;</hi> that blessing the most gracious God, who hath inspir'd these conceptions into my heart; they shall gladly behold, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially receive this <hi>Devotion</hi> as theirs; theirs by my donation, and theirs againe by their imitation, till Gods Spirit work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually with theirs, shall make them flie higher then my region, and so leave me behind in speculation and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And here I would commend my religious labors to the pious Reader, him to the Lord, and so end this Preface; but that I must in charitie warne him not to suffer anie, to cheat him of my gift: for I suppose, there are manie persons, who will (if they can) persuade him to sleight it, upon divers pretexts, according to their various affections.</p>
            <p>One will tell him: My Devotions are
<pb facs="tcp:55440:5"/> vaine, because there are manie far better penn'd then mine.</p>
            <p>Another: that I have too manie Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Ejaculations on one subject.</p>
            <p>A third: that this Devotion being mine, he hath nothing to doe with it, as that which is not fit for him.</p>
            <p>A fourth: that these and all other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yea premeditated prayers are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unlawfull.</p>
            <p>A fift: that though they be good in themselves, yet they are stint prayers, and so ties on the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And so these whisperers shall defraud my Reader of his right in my gift; unles he be truly Wise and Pious: which all men being not, chiefly in this Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in which folie and impietie reigne, I must give here some antidots against all these poisons. Let then the Reader heark to me, and mark thus my defence, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Truths Apologie.</p>
            <p>First, I make Devotions, although there be manie, which may be said to excell mine, because those are not mine, and that
<pb facs="tcp:55440:5"/> I will do more (though not better) then those persons, who have preceded me in time, learning and pietie. He's a provident Child, who improves his Fathers estate.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I compose manie upon one subject, because subjects are not alwayes the same to me, or I varie in the subjects. All nights are not alike to me. I Awake not daily in the same case or temper. I Read not alwayes the same bookes, nor books on one subject. I Eat not daily the same meat, nor with the like appetit. My Conversation is various; so are my Talkes, Mirth and Sadnes, Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. I might run thus through all other subjects, which yet suppose to be alwaies semblable, yet I will have diversitie of thoughts, and choice of affections: for, as my appetit cannot be set long on one sort of meat, but desires some varietie; so my mind should be cloy'd with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or prayer. Besides, my intention in this composition being to give pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or directions for a prudent, vertuous and pious life; I conceive, this can not be
<pb facs="tcp:55440:6"/> done so conveniently in one article, as in manie. If on the contrarie unto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Objection, anie wise man shall think, he could find more and better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits then these are; I wish, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, I am both willing that he should, and well persuaded, that he may: for, I my selfe (although foolish and ignorant) could (with Gods help) have done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the amplification of matters, and invention of new Conceptions and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, if I had not row'd against wind and tide; forcing my<note n="*" place="margin">This word <hi>(Pen)</hi> makes me remember a mistake in the short and small lines of the 104. page, where pen should be instead of tongue. Who knowes, that David call'd his tongue the pen of a readie writer, shall not esteem that a great fault.</note> pen to write, not when my wit was quick (if ever it was so) and my mind most tranquill; but when I was well occupy'd in an unpleasant profession, or could steal some minuts from it. Besides, other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and conceptions being not fit for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie man in generall, but in particular, in regard of some publick or privat calling, are <hi>intended by me for other Devotions,</hi> which both time and leasure may (with
<pb facs="tcp:55440:6"/> Gods assistance) produce, if these be gladly intertain'd: so that both sexes shal then severally find Directions, for a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet and godlie life, in ev'rie Age, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Vocation, Estate.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, although this Devotion be mine, because compos'd by and for me: yet <hi>Ev'rie man may challenge it,</hi> because gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the publick. 'Tis true, I made it first, for mine owne privat use, because I would not be like the Oxe, plowing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ground for other men: yet I suppose, that what is fit for me, as I am a Christian, is convenient for anie man of the same holie profession. What is fit for me in particular, or for few of my<note n="*" place="margin">What this condition is and was, may be knowne hereafter, in one of my Colloques.</note>
               <hi>Condition,</hi> or of some vocation, as Physicians, Lawyers and Historians, in whose names I speak once in the title <hi>Writing,</hi> may be easily observ'd; and who is judicious, may find with great facilitie what's convenient for him. But <hi>printed Devotions</hi> being of late cry'd downe by zeal without knowledge, or by knowledg
<pb facs="tcp:55440:7"/> without honestie &amp; pietie, as unlawfull &amp; abominable to right Christians, I say.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they were otherwise reputed in the Jewish and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church,<note place="margin">Concerning Pray'rs ex tempore and premeditated, See my Catechism, Quest. 1139. &amp;c.</note> whose an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and constant pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice should be sufficient to condemn the censurers of Liturgies. If yet they sleight this old and religious custome, and will not consider with feare, That God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe appointed a form of blessing to Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron and his successors: That Moses, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid and other holie men compos'd Psalmes to be sung in their Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: That John did teach his disciples to pray: and finally, That Christ the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wisdome of God directed his in that dutie, and left them a short and perfect prayer: I shall take it for no disgrace, if they approve not mine. Nay rather I might suspect them as foolish and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, if commended by those persons, who with intolerable impudence disdain to pray God in the words of Christ, in whom onlie he is well pleas'd, and who
<pb facs="tcp:55440:7"/> is or should be our onelie light, way, truth and life.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, I give not my prayers for <hi>limits</hi> to anie, but rather for <hi>dilatation:</hi> for in them I may teach manie, yea thousands of them, who despise such helps, to have pious conceits upon divers subjects, in which yet they did never find anie religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts; no, not so much as morall instructions. Who teaches me to gaine 10. li. on a bargain, shewes me (if I have anie wit) to profit upon more. Neither Gods spirit, nor mans ought to be ty'd: nay they cannot be so. The first is infinit, &amp; like the wind blows where he lists: the second free and quick, yea so quick in his devotions, that for want of pious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, he flies often upon worldlie affaires. Is it not therfore good, to give him work enough in religion, and please him with godlie varietie? Truly, I think, it is; and that <hi>as manie as are perfect, are thus minded.</hi> But because I know, that manie are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise minded, I pray God in Pauls words, <hi>to reveale even this to them.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 I Have sweetly rested this night, free from terrors, sights, noises, dreames and paines, which afflict manie men; and from those no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturne sins, which pollute manie more, both in soule and bodie. <hi>I then lift up my eyes, and open my heart and mouth to thee, gracious God, giving thee cordiall and verball thanks, for thy favors to me. I acknowledge them such, meere favors to thy poore servant, and unworthie creature, who therefore vow
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55440:9"/> thee all love and service. Accept, confirme my vow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. How manie men have lost their lives this night, or led them in feare and sorrow; whilst I have slept soundly, and refresht my bodie? Then let my soule praise now her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server: <hi>And thou, good God, receive of me what thou hast given me, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>thankfull heart for thy favors, a joyfull mind for my preservation, and a pious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, to love thee sincerely, and serve thee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. This I willingly offer thee for morning sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, without either reservation, or power of revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This night hath been unpleasant to my thoughts, and unquiet to my bodie: yea, I have done both sleeping and waking what hath displeas'd that glorious God, by whose power I live. The troubles or feares of the mind, the distemper or paines of the bodie, the sins of both, and causes of those troubles, feare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers and paines are the motive of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent humiliation and supplication. <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging therefore my selfe a vile sinner, and a weak thing; I pray thee, holie and great God, to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to me, in the remission of my sins, and in the donation of thy comforting spirit, by which my whole person be sanctifi'd for thy service, and strengthned for mine owne affaires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Have I not slept enough? Why then doe I delay to rise? Will I now make my bed a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55440:9"/> grave of corruption, and not a place of rest? The Lord forbid. I have been made for other ends, then to sleep out the time, which is due to action. <hi>O then, my God, help me to resist slo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>b, and rise now cheerfully, to follow my calling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands: but this little may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure great, a little sleep great povertie: for, who loves that, shall come to this. I'le then unfold my armes, stretch out my lims, open my eyes, rise, work; that I be satisfi'd with bread. Yet I may rise early, and sit up late in vaine; <hi>Ʋnles, O God, thou blesse my diligence, care and labor. I then beg thy blessing on them and me, which I wholy dedicate unto thy glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Fie, fie on the sluggard. He should be sent with a good whipping to the Ant, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider her wayes, and so be wise. Indeed since man lost the right use of his reason, he may well learne of those creatures, which doe not know, what reason is. Ants, Bees and such small things may teach him to order his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie and common-wealth, and so to humble his proud thoughts, considering, sin hath made him inferior to his underlings. <hi>I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this truth, O God, and since my great Sun is eclips'd, I will gladly borrow some light of these earthlie stars, and in them admire thy wisdome. Make me a docible scholar to their naturall instructions, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55440:10"/> from them raise me to a higher schoole, thy holie and most perfect word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Now my flesh is refresh't, and begins to rebell. I feele lustfull motions, which (unles they be quail'd) shall defile the bodie, and make the soule guiltie. What shall I doe in this case? I will quickly get up, and give her some hard bone to gnaw, thus to keep her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, for idlenes breeds wantonnes, and lust is fomented in doune. <hi>In the meane time coole, O Lord, this heat with thy grace, and as a naile doth expell another; so let the feare of an eternall fire quench the flames of sensualitie, and abate carnall lust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. What makes me thus wanton? Good diet and full sleep, plentie, ease, pleasures, strength and health. Should I (as thousands of poore men) want all these things; or some of them, as manie of the greatest sort, my flesh should not be so lustie, as I with griefe find her. Were I halfe starv'd, on a hard and cold floore, or in the open fields, cross'd in all my desires, weakned by long disease, burnt with feavers or plague, tormented with the stone, gout and the like: then I should groane and crie unto my God for help. Should I doe so? Then since I am not so, and know, that these blessings of plentie, ease, pleasures, strength, health proceed from God, I must sing praises
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55440:10"/> unto him, yea my flesh must rejoyce in him. If I doe otherwise, listening to the lust of the flesh, I prove my selfe an ingrat wretch, and so may draw curse for blessing, penurie for plentie, trouble for ease, griefe for pleasures, infirmitie for strength, and diseases instead of health. Then I will not doe so, not take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in these thoughts or motions: for those things should torture my flesh, and vexe my spirit. Nay rather I will not doe so: for thus I should offend my God, who commands me inward and outward puritie. <hi>Thou, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand'st, give to obey. Thou, who delight'st in pure minds, and chast flesh; make mine such as thou lov'st. Thou Christ, who didst assume our flesh, yea whole nature, let me not henceforth defile that in me, which thou hast purifi'd in thee, and forgive me all my past pollutions.</hi>

               <head>In Opening his Eyes.</head>
               <p n="1">1 I See before my eyes th' effects of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, my selfe alive, and my goods safe. <hi>Then I lift up these eyes to thee, and with them my heart, gracious God, acknowledging thy love to me, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring mine to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. My eyes are open, yet I see nothing, for want of light. The Sun hath not yet wholy forsaken th' other part of the earth. So it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55440:11"/> inwardly to thousands, yea to millions of men. They have curious and acute wits, grave and judicious intellects, yet cannot see what belongs to their salvation, because they want that light, which fully shines on us, the word of truth and life. <hi>O God, let this Sun rise to them, yet never set to us. Send thy Gospel to them, yet let it still remaine with us, and chiefly with me thy servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Sith the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, for care; this must fix his upon the Lord, for hope and dependence. <hi>Though I be a sinner, yet my eyes are on thee, my God: I expect all good things from thee, and will be rul'd by thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. All things are vanitie, yet I will, and doe pray, <hi>Lord, turne my eyes, from beholding va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. Must thou then make me blind? No, but I pray thee, not to permit me, to set my affections on vanitie; or to turne into vanitie, what thou hast made for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and necessarie uses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Strengthen, O God, my carnall eyes, that I daily see thy wondrous creatures, with love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; reade thy converting word, with delight and profit; look prudently to my affaires: and open my spirituall, that I may behold marvellous things out of thy Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The wise mans eyes are in his head, sees afarre off; and wisely considers all things: but the foole walketh in darknes, hath no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55440:11"/> no judicious counsell. <hi>Make me, O God from foolish wise, and wise with honestie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes, to behold the Sun: yet these eyes must not be too bold with it, not staring 'gainst the light, assoon as we awake; but by few turnes being open and shut, thus to preserve their strength. We must doe so with knowledge and wisdome; not presume to get all at once, but by degrees: in infancie feeding on milke, the first rudiments of knowledge: then on stronger and stronger meat, higher maximes of art, and mysteries of religion. <hi>Lord, let me seeke knowledge, according to my capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie: give me capacitie, to conceive what I ought, chiefly, concerning thee and me; and make me wise unto sobrietie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. As the eyes are the windores of the soule, it concernes her to looke to them; least death enter by them, and so kill her. <hi>My God, preserve my eyes for the safetie of the bodie, and make my soule so watchfull over them; that neither gift blind them; nor beautie allure them lewdly; nor vaine honors make them loftie; nor brotherlie prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie envious; and if they have been such, as I confesse it with sorrow, pardon their transgression.</hi>

               <head>In Shifting his Shirt.</head>
               <p n="1">1 THere is such corruption in man, so much uncleannes in his flesh, that unles he use much washing, rubbing, linnen; he shall be offensive to himselfe and others. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take care of the puritie of the flesh, not forgetting that of the soule. <hi>My God, let me not be like the cups of old Pharisees, cleane without, foule within: or like the aples of Sodom, faire and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in the outside, but rotten inwardly. Purifie thou my soule, and make her sound and sweet, by the graces of thy right Spirit; and so let likewise my flesh be, both sound and sweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nastie persons are not fit to live amongst men: for, man should be a pure creature both in bodie and soule, if he would, could follow the dictat of reason, concerning the bodie; and the rules of Gods word, for the puritie of the soule. <hi>Give me, O Lord, to follow both. Let reason direct me in naturall actions; thy word guide me, in spirituall operations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Shirt is foule: therefore I put it off, to put on another, which is both sweet and cleane. Could I doe so with the old man, how happie should I be! My hearts inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are naught, his corruptions most foule, old Adam is hid there. <hi>But thou, my God, who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55440:12"/> didst cast him out of Eden, help me to put him off, with all his vicious workes; and to put on the new, thy Son Jesus, with his divine vertues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I put off this foule Shirt, but for a little while. When it is wash't, I'le put it on again. Time is comming, in which I shall leave this corruptible flesh; but God, in the last day, shall restore it againe to me, immortall. <hi>Grant, sweet Jesu, it be also glorious; and therefore make me here stedfast in faith, aboundant alwayes in thy worke, and looking still for thy comming.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Now I am as naked, as I came from the wombe. O no: I have now more, then I brought thence. I had then but one sin, and now I have thousands. Yet, why should I say so? Have I not truly griev'd for them, and hath not God forgiv'n them me for Christ? Then I am free from them: and then againe, I must be thankfull and carefull. <hi>Make me both, my good Lord; thankfull for thy mercie, carefull to avoid sin, yea the lest occasion of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>While I put on this Shirt, clothe me, O God, clothe me, I beseech thee, with the precious robe of Christs Innocence; that I be not naked before thy glorious majestie. Indue me with knowledge, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, holines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This Shirt refreshes me, because 'tis cleane, sweet, warme. Gods grace is such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the soule, and makes the soule such as it is.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55440:13"/>
                  <hi>O then, my God, let me now feele thy grace, to worke in me these blest effects. Let thy face shine on me, and be thou gracious unto me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Have I not manie Shirts, and other changes of garments, while manie goe naked, or not clothed sufficiently for the weather, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their qualitie and merits? If it be so, I will spare of my aboundance, chiefly to them, who deserve well of Church or State. <hi>Let not, O God, the rich permit, that the poore goe naked, or those in rags and course garments, whose learning, vertue, pietie adorne thy Church, and grace our State.</hi>

As long as man kept his distance from God, he was both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and content: but when he would goe too neere his Maker in knowledge, shame sat upon his face, and spred it selfe upon all his outside; while within sorrow fill'd his heart, and feare possest his mind.

The first garments our parents had, were aprons of fig-leaves, and coats of skins: this last (belike) being made by God, to shew, how pride had made those like beasts, who would be as gods. Though our attire be more costlie; yet it should still represent us our fall, from a blessed to a cursed estate. <hi>Let, O God, mine doe so. When I put on my clothes, let me think on my sins, which (when I was immortall) made me subject to corruption in the bodie, and unto damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both in bodie and soule, unles in mercie thou sav'st me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is hard to leave old customes. As pride was mans first sin; so we can hardly put it off. Rather 'tis fed by us, both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; inwardly, with conceits of bloud, wit and vertue; and outwardly, with beautie, strength, riches, attire: and of these, the last is the worst: for, in that we glorie in weeds, we shew, we sorrow not for sin, the first cause of garments. <hi>O God! let nothing make thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant proud; chiefly, let me not take for foundation of my ostentation, the marke of my parents disgrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Why are men so busie, in seeking curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous apparell, to cover a dunghill? Indeed I cannot much blame them; for, in that they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55440:14"/> imitate God himselfe, who in the frame of our bodies doth hide our inward parts, as unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant unto the sight; and least perhaps we should dislike our old mother the Earth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires her with flowr's and green grasse. Our fault is, that with proud exces we vaile our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes. <hi>Lord, keep me from these sins, and grant, I desire no more clothes, then need and decencie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi>

Yet it happens quite otherwise; for, vile flesh rules, and noble sp'rit obeyes. At least the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die hath the best. I have slept long, and I am long to make my selfe readie, though I will make as much hast, as I can: then I must walk, play, eat and worke, for the pleasure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the flesh, whiles the poore soule lies still unregarded. Yet it shall not be so. I will spend some time upon her, in reading bookes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease her knowledge; and praying God, to obtaine grace. Yea since the soule may be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, while the bodie is in action; rest and lie still, whilst he is in motion, I will take care, that in the midst of my occupations, she think often on God, speak unto him, and heare what he sayes unto her. <hi>O Lord! blesse this resolution, and grant, this day I looke so well unto my selfe, that

               <p n="1">1 WHere's the mirrour, in which I may see, how I looke; seeke in my face markes of health or sicknes; tokens of joy or griefe, and whether it be clean? I see all things are well, as farre as this glasse can shew me. But how are things within? How fares my heart? In what case is my soule? I must exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this; and if I will consult my God, he will tell me: and if I reade wisely his booke, I shall see there my spirituall estate. I'le trie that presently. I will reade it, then pray; yet pray a little, ere I reade. <hi>My God, shew me what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and if the sight be not good, make it so: and if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55440:15"/> good, perfect it. If my soule be diseas'd, heale her; and if well, maintaine her in health. Cleanse her from sin, adorne her with thy grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This glasse flatters, and so 'tis fit for me: for, I flatter likewise, great men, for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the rich, for helpe; the strong, for feare; the faire, for love, or perhaps lust. But what basenes in the adulator, and what follie in the adulated? The first sells the truth and his owne credit, for a dish of pottage: and the second is cheated of the truth, by a flattering tongue, which charmes his eyes and heart so pow'rfully, that he beleeves the contrarie of what he sees, feeles, knowes. If then I doe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter others, and love to be flattered, am I not a base foole? And if I doe flatter my selfe, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining me faire, vertuous, gracious, when beautie, vertue, grace are more remote from me, then the globe of the Sun: what shall I say, I am? Worse then anie mad man, and more blind then a Mole. Then I may say so now; sith I have often flattred my selfe thus: for which being asham'd and full of griefe, <hi>I pray thee, Lord, to be gracious to me, in the free remission of this great transgression, and future prevention of this base, foolish and mad vice. O let me not flatter others, and let not others flatter me: or if they doe't, let me not regard their false words, but shew them my strong aversion of their base wayes, by a sincere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55440:16"/> of my infirmities, and diligent flight from their companie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This Glasse represents me faire or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, with that due proportion and right color, which manie thousands want. So it gives me a double lesson, of vertue and gratitude: for, sith I am faire in bodie, I must not be uglie in mind; and sith my beautie comes from God, I must render him thankes and love. <hi>I doe so now, most glorious Spirit, who art the first and chiefe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; I thanke and love thee heartily, for my amiable feature; beseeching thee to beautifie my soule, with all morall vertues, Christian graces, and to free my heart from those vanities, which are inherent to beautie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. What homelie face have I? How course, yellow or tawnie my skin is? If I am in my selfe, as this Glasse doth represent me, I am a good remedie against love. I should say against lust: for, who is wise, will not love me the lesse, because I want fading and deceitfull beautie: sith I am Gods noble creature, who (belike) made me thus, to shew his infinit pow'r and wisdome, in our diversitie. I will not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine 'gainst him, but rather acknowledge his love, in making me not lesse perfect and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie: for, he might have made me a Toad, or a Hedge-hog. I will neither borrow the help of art, to counterfeit beautie: but will studie to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55440:16"/> have that inwardly, which I want outwardly. I'le make provision of vertue. I'le beg of God humilitie, meeknes, prudence, temperance, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, fortitude, faith, love. If I have these, am I not faire enough? <hi>O then, my God, give me these and all other graces, to cover my corporall imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Give me an upright heart in this crooked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die; pure affections, and sweet disposition, that my squint eyes and stinking breath be not so offensive. Be thus gracious to those, whom thou hast made like me; and let me and them be to the perfect in outward shape, motives of compassion, and not subjects of derision. Direct us all to the possible and lawfull meanes, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie what is amisse in our bodies: or if there be no meanes, then give us patient hearts, to remaine cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully amongst th' outward vessels of worldlie disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; till that time comes, in which the world shall see by our glorious resurrection, that we were truly vessels of honor.</hi>

Not so soone as my life may doe. I will not then trust in the strength of youth, thus to addict my selfe to voluptie: but rather imploy it to the service of its giver, beginning now to beare his yoak. <hi>My God, put it about my necke, and thy bit in my mouth; that I run not away from thee. Let me not looke upon long life
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55440:17"/> as a pretext to carnall libertie, but as faire opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to manifest my gratitude to my bounteous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, by a long and faithfull service. Shall I now live lewdly, because I may live long? Nay rather, I must live better; because if I live long, it is by thy mercie, and mercie must not be abus'd: otherwise justice succeeds it.

The more wrinkles I have, the fewer dayes to live. My weak sight declares me, I am neerer my journies end, if I lose not the way, by looking too much on this flesh, and exces of love to this world. If I doe so, I am a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed foole. <hi>Then, my God, let me not doe so.

How then dare I present my selfe, before thy majestie, in my rags, uncleannes, folie, weaknes? Nay rather, what should I doe else? Must not the poore beg of the rich, that so they be reliev'd?

Must not fools resort to the schoole of the wise &amp; prudent, to know wisdome and instruction, and perceive the words of understanding? Must not the weake leane on the strong, adhere to the mightie, to find support by them? Yes certainly. I must therefore approch thee now, by holie desires of my heart, from whom I have often withdrawne my selfe, by impure affections, wicked actions. Looke now, my God, upon this poore begger. Thou art rich in mercie: O then have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on me, and forgive all my sins, my most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and grievous sins of pride and ambition, malice and infirmitie, knowledge and ignorance, idolatrie &amp;

Wash these and all other impurities in the fountaine of thy Christs bloud: and then with his originall and actuall holines cover my nakednes: that so I be righteous at least by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so he be my righteousnes and sanctification. I pray likewise, that he be my wisdome, that so my fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies appeare not before thee and men; but that he give me such subtilitie, knowledge and discretion, that I attaine unto thy wise counsels concerning my salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and unto those meanes to work it with feare. And that in this and in all other things, I doe thy knowne will from my heart, strengthen me with thy pow'r, in the practice of all vertues and religious duties. Let me not live in ignorance, and let not my knowledge be vaine. And because thou hast alreadie done manie great things for me, in me, I blesse thy glorious name, for thy excessive love to me and all thy Church.

They feare but the justice of

Let me feare thee, and depart from evill; feare and serve thee with all my heart, considering how great things thou hast done for me.

To teach us this, holie Paul counsels us in generall, to give honor to whom honor is due. God commands us in particular, to honor our Parents. Solomon exhorts us, to feare God and the King. Thus then I learne, that after God, I must Honor my Father and Mother, and Feare the King. And as I learne the commandements; so I resolve to yeeld them obedience. I will then Honor my Parents, and I will Feare the King. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I can doe neither, unles my God helpe me, I will thus beg his assistance.</hi> Almighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to whom honor chiefly belongs, and to whom the first feare is due! assist me thy servant, to honor and feare thee above all things; then my Parents and Governors next thee.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55440:20"/> speake of them, and to them, as my relations to them oblige me: as of and to persons, whose honor is my glorie, and their disgrace my infamie.

O let me rather pittie them, beare their infirmities, and pray thee heartily for them: and be thou graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them, in covering their sins of negligence, crueltie, folie, ungodlines, and all others, if yet they are guiltie of these, I have exprest: and giving them the contrarie vertues, yea all the qualities, which are necessarie to persons of their ranke. Where they have been wanting in their duties, forgive mercifully: and that they nere be so, assist them pow'rfully. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don likewise my offences to them, my harsh censures of them; cold affections to them; sleight words of them; irreverent behaviour towards them; want of helpe in their needs, of patience to their corrections, of submission to their prudent, honest counsels, of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their just wills and lawfull commandements. Permit me not to continue in these, much lesse to goe beyond. If they command some injustice, require of me what thou forbid'st; grant me reverend denialls. And if they forbid what thou dost command, let me tell them with great respect: thou art the greatest

And if they'le compell me to injust obedience, give me a prudent and stout heart: prudent, to appease their anger by satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie reasons; or avoid their furie by flight: and courageous, to endure their torments, with Christian fortitude. Give the same heart unto all Children and Subjects, and generally to all men, under autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Let no more Hams be found in privat fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; no Jeroboams in Kingdomes. Let likewise no drunken fathers give occasions of derision to their children; nor hard Rehoboams provoke Subjects to rebellion, by grievous servitude. Let Parents be sober, discreet, loving to their Children. Let Kings be kind to their people, please them, and speake good words to them, following the counsell of the prudent old men. That all this be, and till this be, by thy effectuall grace, pitie and relieve those, who are opprest, abus'd by them, who should ease, honor them. Regard the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie yoakes about the necks of manie children, subjects and servants, and make them light. Consider the disgrace of Parents, Kings, Princes, great men, whose honor lies now in the dust, whose glorie is eclips'd, whose faces are covered with shame, and whose hearts are full of sorrow. And amongst Princes and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, consider ours and us, the King and People of this Land: the King once potent and glorious; tho People rich, great and happie: but now made weake, poore, despis'd, unhappie, by the child of our lusts, and effect of our jealousies, a long and unnaturall warre.

Within few dayes I pray'd thee to maintaine thy Church: but now I beseech thee, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large her borders to the ends of the earth. Contract, yea destroy Satans black kingdome, and extend thy glorious dominion upon all Nations of the earth. Holie and heavenlie Father, let now thy name be sanctified by all men, let them acknowledge thy Kingdome, and let thy will be done in all the earth, as it is in heaven.

Send me those men, or me to them, who shall preach me the word of truth, in demonstration of the spirit; and let thy spirit illuminat and move my heart, to understand and beleeve it. Let me reade it often, not by custome, and so in vaine; but as the word of truth, salvation, life; and so to instruct and save me. Let it informe my understanding, affect my heart, direct my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

As we love the laborious Bee, and hate the idle Drone; so God is well pleas'd with those men, who, by a lawfull profession, get honestly some meanes to live; and is angrie with them, whose hand is weake to worke, but strong to steale; or who, with a base mind and fawning tongue, seeke at other mens ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles what theirs cannot afford. <hi>O God! let me not be so slacke, that I refuse to worke; nor so vile, that I seeke my living by abject meanes and vicious courses.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 BY labor man gets strength both of bodie and soule; yet it must be moderate, else it doth much weaken the flesh, and dull the mind. Rest is needfull to both; for, after a little breathing we run with more swiftnes. Now then I leave my worke, to rest or walke a while. <hi>O Lord, blesse so my rest and recreation, that it be no offence to thee, nor hind'rance unto my labor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis both easie and most wholesome to walke; for, of all exercices 'tis the lest vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Besides, the senses find abroad what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light them, and through them may convey knowledge into the mind. <hi>Let now, O God, my bodie get strength by walking, and my soule receive instructions by beholding the beautie of thy creatures, hearing their melodie, smelling their sweetnes, and observing their severall proprieties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I walke in health and mirth, whilst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie men lie languishing, depriv'd of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Some are walking in heavines, others possest with feare run away from their owne countries. Am I better then they? No, no; but God spares me, because he pities me. <hi>O then I blesse his Name, beseeching him to deale still graciously with me, and looke in compassion upon all afflicted persons.</hi>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55440:37"/>4. In walking I see, that my feet beare the whole weight of my bodie, and are the first in motion: and so I doe observe, that godlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are the next foundation, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners of good workes; for, good thoughts goe before good deeds. <hi>Let therefore, Lord, my affections be such, as beare fruit of a sweet relish; and grant, that both affections and actions be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon faith and hope.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. As I doe walke, no part of me touches the ground, but the soles of my feet; yet searching mine owne heart, I find it full of earth. But how is that earth come thither? Surely I got it by a fall, when I was in the wombe. My mother fell, and she and I were all bemir'd: yea, the durt is so old and drie, that no rubbing or washing can take it away. We doe love earth and earthly things, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les God himselfe cleanse, or alter our hearts, they can receive but earth. <hi>Therefore, my God, wash my foule heart with thine owne bloud, or create in me another, which be as faire as this is blacke.</hi>

That as I came out but to walke, then must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to my habitation; so I am borne to stay here but a while, from my everlasting dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

               <p n="1">1 ALl things have their seasons. The night succeeds the day, and againe this doth expell that. Could the Sun stand still in our horizon, he should burne all our fruits; and might darknes last long, all things should die for want of heat. We should in our actions imitate the course of nature, chuse time to watch and sleep, fast and feast, work and play, and never confound them. The best time to play is in the morning, and before meales; for then bodies are lighter, and naturall heat is by easie motion prepar'd for the digestion of the meat, which after meales is hindred by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent exercices, yea also by singing and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much. <hi>O thou the Maker of nature! teach thy servant so to order his time, that his whole frame be kept in good temper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To weep alwayes with sad Heraclitus, or continue laughter with light-hearted Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, is alike censurable. The meane is the best in all things. I will weep, when there's
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55440:38"/> cause; then I will laugh, least sorrow should contract my heart too much. I am wearie to work, or read: therefore I'le play a little, that by, ease and recreation I get new forces to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. <hi>As thou, O Lord, hast been with me in the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of my calling, so vouchsafe now, to be with me in all my playes, and direct them thy selfe, both to thy glorie and my good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. All playes are not fit for all men. We must chuse those, which best besuit either our nature, or calling. Then we must looke, they be lawfull, and that if we play for money, we never venture more, then we can lose, without injurie to our selves, wives, children, friends and poore: for certainly, if these want what we lose, we stake our soules with the money. <hi>Let me, O God, observe all these, and never suffer me to play that, which may procure me griefe, or my friends want.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not good to make toile of a toy: yet those doe it, and so doe ill, who play at too hard games, either for the bodie or soule; those doe much worse, who in their playes have a covetous mind: and those the worst of all, who by deceit win other mens money; for, that's a theft, which argues a base mind. Such gamesters would never refuse to cut a purse, should they not feare shame, or hanging. <hi>Lord, grant, that in my playes, I avoid these three faults,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55440:39"/> and never play with them, whose minds are so cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Doe they begin to sweare and wrangle, and to turne jeast into earnest? Hath our play bred anger, and anger contention? Then either the play's naught, or the gamesters foolish. <hi>Quiet our minds, good Lord; and suffer not, we lose our peace and mutuall love, to win a game, whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit can never equall our losse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis play'd enough. As too much labor or studie dulls the mind, and consumes the bodie; so long playes slacken both, and make us loath to worke againe. I will therefore retire, <hi>beseeching thee, my God, to pardon all the faults, which my fellowes and I have committed in this our sport, both against thee and everie one of us. And because in these playes, I have receiv'd no harme, whereas manie in the like games, lose often their money by ill playing, their friends by cheates, mistakes, quarrells; and their lims and lives by fighting; I heartily thanke thee, good God, for my present preservation from all dangers, deceits and losses.</hi>

But what a wise worldling am I in this, and what a foole in better things? How doe God and Satan disagree? yet I would daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in my heart, by halting between both. But now, my soule, if the Lord be thy God, intertaine him alone, and shut the Devill out. <hi>Come then, my God, come and enter into my heart, that it may be at rest.</hi>

Not so I trust; for I neither doe this daily, nor (thankes to God) eat greedily my meat. As for beggers, none must lie at my doore, in expectation of my crums: for, God forbid, I should send the scraps of my table and trenchers to them, who in nature are as good as I, and in vertue and grace perhaps better. They shall have store of good, cleane and well-drest meat, that their bowels blesse me. <hi>Lord, pitie them, and accept that poore reliefe, I give them for thy sake. And because much talking and feasting are never without sin, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, good God, both these my friends and me our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in words and diet, and the evill thoughts of our hearts.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. I am bid to a feast, yet I will stay at home; for, some are bid likewise, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie may make me worse. They are usually drunke, then pick quarrell with their best friends. <hi>Keep me, O Lord, from such mens compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, least they teach me their evill wayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It is better to goe to burials, then to feasts: for, there we have images of death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, which draw our soules to sad thoughts of dissolution: and here we find musick, pastime, good cheere, which so sweeten our lives, that we love them above measure. <hi>But thou, O Lord! let not my soule be drawne away from the meditation of her assured end, to the desire of longer life, then that, thou hast appointed me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. It burials make us thinke on death, why should not feasts represent us heaven? My bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die must be as that corps, laid in earth to feed wormes; and so my soule may be as merrie in heaven, as I am at a feast, yea thousand times merrier. <hi>Lord, let burials put me in mind of death, and let my feasts be so full of innocent pleasures; that my heart be on those heavenlie joyes, thou hast pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for thine elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. When I goe to a feast Christ forbids me, to sit in the highest place; and Solomon, to eat and drink first. The one shewes pride, the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55440:44"/> other greedines, which is likewise bewray'd by an eye rounding all the dishes. I must then sit and eat, according to my state and need: If I doe more, I shall draw both envie and shame. <hi>Let, sweet Saviour, thy counsels take root in my heart, that by humilitie and sobrietie, I please thee and all men.</hi>

               <p n="9">9. I goe to a Wedding, which is a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, grac'd with Christs presence and first miracle. The same vouchsafe to be at this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, that as at such celebration, he did change water into wine; so he turne all the crosses and afflictions of these persons into ease and consolation. <hi>Blesse them, good Lord, with sincere love, united wits, prudent minds, sober bodies, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient meanes, vertuous children.</hi>

This man hath spar'd no cost, for here is varietie of meat; so that his guests may chuse what they like best, as indeed I see, they doe all; for, they eat with good appetit: at which our feast-maker seemes to take great delight. God hath daily a greater feast, to which all men are call'd: but some refuse to come, others come without cleane garments, the third sort hath crasie stomachs, and the fourth eats his meat. <hi>If I will not come, Lord, force me in: if I want the wedding garment; Lord, give it me: If my stomach is weake; Lord, strengthen it; so that (to make good thy eternall election) I receive thy

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. I goe to a Baptisme, where before or after the Infant be baptiz'd, there is some meat and drinke, to shew the Parents joy, in the birth of their child. Indeed children are Gods blessing, and subjects of joy to their friends, when they take godlie courses. If not, they are causes of griefe, and breeders of sorrow. <hi>O Lord! blesse this with such quietnes in its infancie, and honestie through all its age, that its parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, and thou be glorifi'd in it.</hi>

If they have not; yet thou maist goe, and offer thy selfe unto them; for, both they and their house are thine: but if they have; then, Lord, be there betimes, and blesse their persons and dwelling.

               </p>
               <p n="6">6. There is a fast which vertue bids; and that is both measure in meats, and abstinence from vice. So good mens lives are continuall fastings; for, they never exceed in the first, nor give themselves to the second. Such fast is pleasant unto God: for, his eyes love a sober flesh, and a pure mind. <hi>O Lord! make me such, as thou lov'st. Let me avoid exces in meats, and keep me from vicious humors, and all sinfull actions.</hi>
               </p>

This fast is likewise pleasant unto God, and of great use 'mongst godlie men. Yet, as preservatives are better then purgations, <hi>so let me, Lord, use this fasting, before the flesh rebell, and wound the soule to death.</hi>

That's naturall to them, and necessarie unto this. From the hie God, to the lowest creature, there is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all giving and taking. Onely some men would freely take alwayes, and never give; and in that they shew themselves bad citizens in this great common-wealth. <hi>Lord, let me not be one of them.

He gives being, and what belongs to it; yet he desires but obedience and praise: and that he hath freely of all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, except man. Of man chiefly God would have both, not because he needs them (for in that we may see and say, he is our God, that he hath no need of our goods) but for mans owne profit: for, as this being is but little considerable, unles we obtaine another, which be happie and perpetuall, and that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

So then God is the first giver to me: yea such giver, that I can give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what I have receiv'd of him. Yet if I give him that willingly, he doth thanke me, and confesse himselfe my debtor. <hi>O gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God! who would not give thee what is thine, and so have thee ingaged by vertue of thy promises?

His wise Maker knew his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and saw, it was not good, that man should be alone. I can therefore but dislike those, who flie from companies to live amongst wild beasts; or (though they dwell in great cities) have no familiaritie with men; but passe their lives with images, bookes and skuls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les it be once or twice everie week. Indeed they follow their nature, in frequenting their like: for, as those men are dead to generous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so they doe wittily (if not well) to sort themselves with dead mens workes and bones. <hi>Let me not, O good God, burie my selfe alive, spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my time in idlenes, and feeding my melancholick humors; but grant me wit to chuse my time, both to converse, and be alone.</hi>

Some say, Wise men can never be alone: for, if they want men, they have bookes; and if these faile, their minds are free to walke with the angels, and talke with God himselfe. This may be true for a short time, but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not last long. Our soules are here ty'd by a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55440:79"/> string, which quickly puls them downe. The cares of the bodie, and the thoughts of the world make us often in a moment fall downe againe from the highest heaven.

               <p n="3">3. We must live in our solitude, as if we were in companie, and never thinke, we may then sin, because no man sees us: for, who made man, and can save or damne him, hath alwayes his eyes upon us, yea within us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding our actions, and weighing our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. <hi>Let me, O God, set thee alwayes before me, and be thou still at my right hand, to guide me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in this world.</hi>

In all lawfull actions, we must doe as the rest; yet we may trie, to doe better, then they. So by imitation, we doe please them; and by doing better, we reforme in them what's a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse.

               <p n="5">5. In our conversation we must shew respect unto our betters, gentlenes to our inferiors, and courteous freedome to our like: reward our friends with mutuall love, and so deale with our enemies, that we avoid their snares, and reconcile their minds. Friends may be lost, and enemies won; we must therefore be neither too free with the first, nor too severe with the second. Let those, who in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence doe well, receive our praise and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, and the others our discreet reproofe and gentle dissuasion. <hi>Grant, my good Lord, that I observe all these in my conversation.

The Wisdome of God commends us the prudence of Serpents, and the simplicitie of Doves: as these being most requisit in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. <hi>Give me these, O Christ my Wisdome: give me a prudent wit, to looke well to my wayes, fore-see the evill, and hide my selfe: and harmles, least I injure others.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. The world is like the sea, full of storms, rocks and sands; and so ought to be shun'd:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55440:80"/> yet as the sea hath some calme 'twixt the stormes, and manie places free to the navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so the world is not alwayes, and everie where perillous. We may then deale with it as we doe with the sea; saile in the calme, and land when we see the weather boisterous; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with men, when they are quiet and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: then retire to our owne dwellings, when their passions rage against their reason. There in our meditations, we shall by the windowes of quick apprehension see worldlings tossed to and fro, as a small boat in a tempestuous sea. <hi>O Lord, teach me to walke upon the waters of this world, when time doth serve; and take me thy selfe by the hand, when the wind is too strong, and I begin to sinke.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. The world is either the whole universe of heav'n and earth with their creatures, or the whole mankind. Being taken in the first sence we cannot flie from it, and in the second we must not: unles we (Timon-like) hate our semblable, as being all naught, whereas often none's worse then we. Were all men led with the same sp'rit as manie black minds are, then farewell all societie. <hi>Let me not, Lord, hate those whom thou hast made; forsake my like, shun men as snakes, yet lurke in holes like a serpent.</hi>

The first is the Church of God, and the second the assemblie of the wicked, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels and reprobate. We must strive to live in the first, least we be starv'd; for 'tis our Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem (the house of bread) where Christ is born to us; the pasture, where God feeds his sheep; and the fortres, where he keeps them. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we must depart from, if we are in; and come not neere, if we are out: for, they sit in darknes and the shadow of death. <hi>Keep me, O God, within the bosome of thy Church, and let me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver walke in the counsell of the ungodlie, stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornfull.</hi>

They will impart me some; yea enough to see mine owne wayes. Good men will teach me goodnes; the mercifull, pitie; the upright, true dealing; the harmles, innocence; the modest, chastitie; the humble, lowlines; the courteous, affabilitie; the sober, temperance; the prudent, discretion; the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, fortitude; the constant, stabilitie; the thankfull, gratitude; the sad, gravitie; the merrie, cheerfulnes. <hi>Let me, O God, converse with such, as can make me good by counsels, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by their owne examples: and when I am with

A companion of fooles shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy'd: who toucheth pitch shall be defil'd therewith; and who hath fellowship with a proud man, shall be like unto him: for, ill manners are as the contagion, infecting their neighbours. The proud man doth poison our minds with loftines, the glutton with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, the covetous with avarice, the voluptuous with wantonnes, the prodigall with lavishnes, the cheater with deceits, the theefe with pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, the wrangler with debate, the chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick with anger, the cruell with violence, the oppressor with extortion, the drunkard with quaffing, the impudent with boldnes, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinat with wilfulnes, and the sluggard with idlenes. <hi>Let me not, Lord, converse with such, as can make me worse then I am, by ill examples and counsels; or if I need to be with them, let not their instructions enter into my heart, nor their behaviour please my eyes; but grant, that loving their persons, I hate their ill manners.</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55440:82"/> better for us to shut our selves in a caverne, then to be familiars with such, as the Apostle wishes us to forbeare, fornicators, covetous, idolaters, railers, drunkards, extortioners. <hi>Keep me, good Lord, from such mens companies, who drinke sin like water, devise mischiefe upon their beds, and whose bowes are bent, and their arrowes readie upon the string, to shoot privily at the upright in heart. Let them not wind themselves in my good opinion, and by their words, smoother then butter and softer then oyle, persuade me to like their doings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Ill companies are worse then pestilence: for, they infect the mind, when contagion doth poison but the bloud. Yet as we may with a cordiall come often neere the plague, without receiving infection; yea drink poison it selfe without harme, after we have taken an antidote: so when our minds are well resolv'd on a religious course, armed with pray'r, and led with good meaning, we may safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with ungodly persons; for, we must not beleeve, that Paul forbids it so strictly as some doe imagine: for, he would not the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians should think, that he gave them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, to forbeare the companie of the forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators of this world; for then he knew, there were so manie fornicators, covetous, &amp;c. that they must goe out of the world; but he forbad their acquaintance with them of the Church,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55440:82"/> who were such. Now if his reason was good then, why not now? since all men live with so little regard of their Christian calling, that he must goe out of the world, who is afraid to keep companie with those, of whom holie Paul speaks. For, which of us can say now; Who can accuse me of fornication, or covetousnes, or idolatrie, or railing, or drunkennes, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion? Therefore we must in this time imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the charitable Samaritan, when we find in our way anie man wounded in the soule; not passe by him, as the Priest did, but goe to him, and bind his wounds, stay his ill course by good examples and counsels; poure in oyle and wine of sweet and comfortable words; put him on our owne beast, shew him the ground of our owne hope concerning the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of our sins, and the salvation of our soules; and bring him to the Inne, the holie Church of God. <hi>O gracious Redeemer, who cam'st to seeke out the lost sheep, and call sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; give me a heart sensible of my brethrens offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against thy majestie; a willing mind, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw them from sin; a holie behaviour and gracefull utterance, to persuade them with deeds and words to lead a better life: and while I shall be thus imploy'd, preserve me from their infection; and grant, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies have more vertue, then their disease.</hi>

Was not Christ conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and eating with sinners? and hath he not and his Apostles exhorted us in manie places, so to let our lights shine before men, and be so holie in all manner of conversation, in the midst of a crooked nation, that God be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd, and sinners converted to him? Then S<seg rend="sup">t</seg>. Pauls prohibition, to eat with fornicators, &amp;c. must be understood either in the Sacrament, or with strangers to us, but not of our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, masters, neighbours and friends: for, with these we may keep acquaintance, and must strive by faire meanes, to bring them into the right way, when they are gone astray. <hi>Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep! make me (I beseech thee) so perfect in all good workes, that men be turn'd by my example from their manifold sins, to serve thee in holines and righteousnes all the dayes of their life.</hi>

               <p n="16">16. To be good with good men is no true token of goodnes; but to be such with the wicked is a witnes of sound vertue; and to convert them from their lewd wayes to godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is an act so glorious in Gods eyes, that he will make such persons shine like the lights of the firmament, and be call'd great in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>Good Lord, make me good at all times and in all companies; but double my goodnes, and blow my zeale, when I converse with evill men; that thou speaking by me, and working both in me and them, their soules be brought from a sinfull to a gracious estate.</hi>

Amongst all the wicked, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation we must shun, hereticks are the first, because their false doctrine may quickly poison us, unles our faith be well grounded, and our hope strong.

He loves me at all times, in summer and winter; stickes close to me in prosperitie and adversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, honor and infamie; gives me prudent counsels, to order my affaires; and religious, in the service of God.

Shall I then regard him? Yes, though not as a friend. <hi>Give me, O God, the spirit of discretion, in the election of my friends: least I take dissimulation for sincere affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and give honestie to all dissemblers, that they love the persons, more then the wealth and honors of all these, whose profest friends they are.</hi>

He is an angrie man, with whom I will make no friendship: a drunkard or prater, who cannot conceale my counsels: a lover of ill companies, a derider of godlines, a vicious and irreligious person. I must not then shake hands with him, nor goe with him; least I should learne his wayes, and get a snare unto my soule. <hi>Let me not, Lord, contract friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship

See, how modest all his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell is, how grave his lookes without severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. I heare commendations of his sobrietie, justice and pietie, without hypocrisie. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation drawes others to the love of vertue, his tongue declares them the wonders of God, unfolds his mysteries, invites them to his love. I will now go to him, or shortly seek means to begin a strait friendship with him. <hi>Let those, O Lord, let those be my friends, who love thee, and by whose help I know thee more and more, love thee with more sinceritie, serve thee with more fidelitie.</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55440:87"/> to disperse his sad thoughts, cherish his heavie soule, and help me and other his friends to relieve him in his distres, that he may praise thy Name for our fidelitie.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. Yonder goes one, who seems not to know me, or whom I would not see: yet he hath been my friend, but now is lost to me, or I to him. So nothing is constant on earth, and so I learne, that we must not be too bold with our friends, least we lose them; nor too lavish of our secrets to them; least they prove false, and basely betray us. <hi>O my God, let me die, rather then be so base; and let me live circumspectly, that I feare not the treacherie of other men.</hi>

There is something between this friend and me, which cooles our affections: and so I see, we are not wise, nor worthie to have friends, sith we cannot cover, excuse, forgive their faults. Who will have a friend without vice, must seek him in heaven. <hi>Shew us this, O wise God, and reconcile our minds, that our amitie end not thus, but it be permanent.</hi>

               <p n="1">1 SIth Man is born unto trouble, and subject unto miserie, he must, if he be wise, make good provision of patience against the evill day: and the more he's honest, the more ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and religious; his provision must be greater, and sooner made, because his portion of pleasures is not on earth, but troubles, want, and bitternes of soule are here reserv'd for him. <hi>I cannot, O my God, I cannot say, I am ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and religious, unles I be such in some cold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of vertue, weak indeavours in pietie: yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my life is expos'd to great and daylie afflictions,

               <p n="2">2. He is not fit to reigne with Christ, who will endure nothing for Christ, and so will not imitate Christ, who certainly did not live here in plentie, pleasures and honor, but in great povertie, feares, griefes and humilitie. <hi>As I am a Christian by name, so, my God, let me be in deed, in conforming my life to that of thy deare Son, as much as 'tis possible, in meeknes and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, fortitude and patience; delighting more to beare my crosse after him, and drinke gall with him, thee to sit in chaires of honor, and enjoy the sweetest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, the world and flesh can afford me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Adversitie hath in it great utilitie: for, it shewes us, all things are vanitie, and so no fit objects of the love of mans soule. <hi>Let then not be of mine, O thou the soverain and permanent Good. Have all, my heart can give, yet still I shal owe more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Adversitie is a mirrour truly represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves and our neighbours, their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to us, and our strength in vertue: for, if they assist us in our calamitie, they are true
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55440:94"/> friends; if they leave us, they are but counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit. So if we faint in adversitie, our strength is but small; but if we resist it, retaine in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie our vertue and integritie; our freedome to good in captivitie, our fortitude in the greatest torments, Gods truth in the dayes of apostasie: then with joy we may say, we are approv'd to God, we are right in his sight. That I may know and say so much, <hi>I will, O God, I will eat willingly the bread of adversitie, drinke the waters of affliction, whensoever it shall please thee, to present them to me; but I pray thee to make those bits and drops easie, by the consideration, that my affliction is but a triall of vertue, or a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling from my sins. If then I be bound in fetters, and held in cords of affliction, shew me my workes, open my eares to discipline, and effectually command me to returne from iniquitie. O chuse and refine me in the furnace of affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. How weak, poore and abject am I! All things crosse my desires. My friends stand afar off, my neighbours revile me, manie oppresse, but none relieves my soule wearie of life. Then I will turn my eyes from this deceitful world, from these false friends, slandering neighbors, inhuman oppressors, and fix them on those glorious globes, which rowle over my head, and beyond them set my heart upon their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, whom I consider afflicted with me. Why

Thou canst not; for, thou art gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Then comfort now my heavie soule, by the apprehension of thy love towards me. So shall my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction be light, and I happie in my adversitie.</hi>

               <head>His Mirth and Sadnes.</head>
               <p n="1">1 MIrth and Sadnes follow our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meditation; for, such as these are, those must be. We do rejoyce at our friends happines, grieve at their miseries, and at our enemies unkindnes: so thoughts of heaven breed our mirth, and the consideration of hell brings sadnes; and so mans heart is between these passions, not knowing which to chuse, yea often unable to make his choice: for, they are both so violent, in following their owne objects, and these objects so manie and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; that reason can seldome rule them. <hi>Strengthen mine, gracious God, that it ever sway affection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As action and meditation agree well; so mirth and sadnes make a good match. Action is vanitie without meditation, and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without action, is but dull idlenes: mirth is foolish without sadnes, and sadnes hurtfull
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:55440:95"/> without mirth. Pound them both together, and they shall make a good compound. But if one put downe the other, they shall doe to the soule what a predominant humor does unto the bodie, destruction must follow: mirth makes her light and insolent, by sadnes she growes desperate. <hi>O God, let neither of these two be alone, nor one too strong for the other: but grant, that as in my feares I may hope, and likewise feare in hopes; so in my mirth I may feele some sadnes, and in sadnes some mirth. Lord, let like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise my face and behaviour be such, as my friends see in them both a sad mirth, and a merrie sad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es: no spightfull frownes at unpleasant actions, nor immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate laughing, or foolish grinning at delightfull objects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. How light am I? But what is the cause of my mirth? A good bargaine, a new honor, a commendation of a friend, or perhaps of a flatterer, a suit at law obtain'd, a love granted of a faire maid to be my wedded wife, an heire borne unto my estate, new possessions added unto the old, or plentie succeeding my penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie? Then downe, my heart, leap not so hie; for, some of these things may away with greater speed, then they are come. <hi>Vouchsafe, my Lord, to blesse me long with the fruition of this thing, which doth procure my present joy, and grant,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:55440:96"/> I set no more love upon it, then such fraile thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, that so its losse vexe me the lesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. How light am I? But what is the cause of my mirth? A holie motion in my heart? A constant purpose to doe well? A true desire of godlines? A sense of Gods favor? A persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his eternall love? Then, my heart, be merrie, and let my soule be joyfull in my God; for, he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, and covered me with the robe of righteousnes. <hi>Lord, let the cause of my joy last, and let me not sleight these motions; but grant, I doe till death, as well as I doe purpose now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Is a reward prepar'd for me in heav'n? and is my name writ in the Book of life? Why then am I heavie for this light affliction? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the worldlie and death-working-sorrow. Must I grieve for a toy, for the losse of a pin, for a child or friend dead, for a man, now angrie with me, although I have given him no cause, whilst God loves me, and keeps for me an incorruptible crowne of glorie? <hi>Let me not, O good Lord, sleight thee and thy heavens so much, as to regard a small losse, or disgrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Had I no sin, I could live merrily; for, I should neither feele paine, nor feare ill: but since my case doth not stand so, joy must give place unto sorrow; till I have bewailed my
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55440:96"/> sin; for then my sorrow must be gone, and I will rejoyce in the Lord, who shall break off my bonds. <hi>O God! grant, my sorrow worke repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to salvation; and, Lord, forgive me my offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that godlie joy may fill my heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Now my sins are brought before me. Now they all appeare like monsters, to terrifie my soule; and like lions, to devoure my darling. Well, well, let them so terrifie, that they make me run to Christ, for refuge. Let these li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hell so pursue me, that I seek and bring against them the Lion of Judah, to force them back into their dark dungeon. <hi>Are not, O Christ, are not my sins washt in thy bloud? How then can they appeare so foule? Is not my injustice cov'red with the robe of thy originall innocence and actuall righteousnes? How then can she fright me by her uglie visage, infernall countenance? O Christ, comfort now my sad heart, with a full persuasion, that my sins are pardon'd, my transgressions cov'red, and my spots washt. Sweet Jesus, speake peace to my heavie soule; least the remembrance of my grievous sins make her become so desperat, that she forget thy infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit merits. Let no more sin enter my thoughts, but to make me thankfull to thee, for its free remission; and carefull of my wayes, that they be not as they have been, leading to perdition, but tending unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Why am I now become so sad? Because
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55440:97"/> (belike) my joy was not in God, without whom mirth is but sorrow, pleasure but pain, sweetnes but bitternes. I sought mirth in the flesh, sport in the world, and content in riches; but now I see, the end of that is heavines and affliction. Had I grounded my joy in the graces of the Spirit, and the mercies of God, I should possesse it still. But since 'twas otherwise, and is now gone from me, I will not run after; but rather strive to get a mirth, which no man take from me. <hi>O Lord, help me in this purchace; give me that peace, which the world cannot give, that blessed joy, which wicked hearts cannot savour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. I am heavie, yet doe not know the cause of my present sadnes. And so alas! man is so wretched a creature, and of such fraile nature, that a small thing can afflict him: a litle flie torment his flesh, a sleight griefe vexe his sp'rit. Yet as he's reasonable, judgement must guide his actions, and prudence order his motions. I will therefore rowse up my spirits; that I lowre not, when I may as well laugh as weep. If my dangers are great, what are my helps? If I may feare, can I not likewise hope? If God is but with me, who shall be against me? <hi>Let thy face, gracious God, shine on my distrest heart; and lift up now thy countenance upon my heavie soule; then these mists shall vanish, and my sad soule rejoyce in thee.</hi>

Riches are attractive: for, as Christ saith, Where our treasure is, there also our hearts are: and for that cause he advises his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to lay up theirs in heaven: in which words I conceive, he gives them a double lesson: First, to give him in his poore members a part of their treasure, which he may keep in heav'n for them. Secondly, that they excessively love not those riches, which are not permanent, but set their thoughts and affections on him, who shall never faile them. These lessons I would gladly learne, although I be not rich, and the Lord grant, that all wealthie men goe with me unto Christs and Pauls school. <hi>Call us, O Christ, call and teach us, not to be high-minded, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

So Paul commands it to the Church of Corinth, and rejoyces to see it in spirit amongst the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Colossians. Whence I conclude, that if I sleight Order in Church or State, and observe it not in all things, I am not worthie to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd truly faithfull, and to passe for a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man. <hi>O thou, who art the Author of Order, not of confusion, teach me order in my privat affaires,

               <head>His Silence and Talk.</head>
               <p n="1">1 AS by meditation we are taught, how to behave our selves in our conversation; so in Silence we learne to speake: and these must goe by turnes, as well as the others. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them must have its place and time: si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence becomes our solitude, and companies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire our talkes. As for the time, we must speak,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55440:102"/> when we see, our words may doe good, or procure innocent delight; and be silent, when the matter's too hie for us, or our speeches are not welcome. <hi>Lord, teach me both the place and time to speake and be silent; and grant, that when my tongue is held within my teeth, my mind discourse and walke with thee; and when I speake, season my words; that they be in the eares of my auditors, as morning dew to a drie ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To be silent, when we must speaks and speak, when we should be silent, is alike cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable. Then to speak so, that our hearers may not understand our meaning, is a thing to be avoided: likewise too curious and trim speeches, or harsh and low discourses must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be forborne, or discreetly made before them, whose minds love such. And to speak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our practice is a hie self condemnation. If our words be against our deeds, men will sooner judge us, then mend themselves. <hi>Lord, let me make my actions good, that they give weight unto my words; and let me so order my speeches, that by them thou receive glorie, and my auditors and I gaine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. I love silence, when it is not abus'd; that is, when it waits on meditation, gives heed to instruction, and heares other men speake; but Monkes and Friers silence I dislike, as foolish and superstitious: for, it is ty'd to constant
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55440:102"/> times and places, out of which they may talk, till they be hoarse and drie. To speak too fast is a signe of folie, and too long and frequent discourses are seldome without vanitie, and never without sin. But to be long silent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes a surlie mind and spightfull heart: yet as their silence is constrain'd, by the rigor of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious lawes, I may free some of them from the imputation of those vices, which for their sakes I wish, were the greatest, they have. <hi>Lord, shew those poore soules their errors; give them another light, then that they have by their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers traditions; quench their thirst with other waters then those, they draw out of the Well of their merits. Teach them to pray, sing, fast, goe bare-foot, whip themselves, and keep their long silence, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their flesh without thoughts of merit; with good intention to please thee, and not with presumption, to make thee their debtor, by reason of their workes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Fooles must heare wise men speak, and young men give eare to the old: so both may learne wisdome; whereas the first bewray their folie by their tongue, and the second their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Let them propound their doubts, and mark well their resolution from the wise braines of the learned and grave. So fooles may be esteemed wise, and children thought hopefull young trees. <hi>When I am in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, Lord, let me instruct them: but when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse

               <p n="5">5. Silence is a great vertue in women, and so much the greater, because their sexe is given to pratling. She's therefore wise, who hath reform'd that common vice. Wives should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the rule of the Apostle, not speake at Church, nor teach in companie; but learne at home of their husbands. <hi>Since mine doth so, Lord, I thanke thee; and that all women doe so, I earnestly pray thee. Teach them, O Lord, humilitie towards all men, submission unto their husbands, and to witnesse their submission, indue them with silence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Servants and inferiors must either keep silence, or speak with great heed and respect before their masters and betters: for, with a sober tongue and modest speeches they will better shew their respect, then with bare heads and long legs, or low courtesies. <hi>Lord, when I keep servants, let them so deale with me; and grant, I honour my betters, as I will be regarded by my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors.</hi>

And 'tis wisdome, to tell our tales unto our selves, before others heare them; for, then we learne, how to expresse our thoughts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55440:103"/> that, which we will keep secret. <hi>Let the onelie wise God teach me this, and help my soule to looke unto her wayes; that I offend not with my tongue by idle words, foolish talkes, and unsavourie tales.</hi>

Make me readie to heare, and slow to speake; and as unwilling to interrupt others, as I am to be stopt, before my tale be told.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Evill communication corrupts good manners, and lewd talkes taint chast minds. Lust creepes into the heart, as well by the eare, as by the eye: lascivious words are as pow'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to blow the fire, as wanton lookes. <hi>Then God forbid, my tongue should be the bellowes to kindle lust, since it is made to be a trumpet or an organ, to sing her glorious makers praise.</hi>

If we ought not to speake ill of a man, without prudent caution or great necessitie; is it lawfull to speake slightly of the creator of all men? to blaspheme the God of heaven and earth? Or if anie does it in our presence, shall love or feare to or of the partie command us then silence? No, no: neither of these is good, but both are verie ill. O let not the maker of my tongue be offended by it in speeches or si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? <hi>Let it O Lord, let it rather cleave to my roofe, or rot in my mouth, then utter a slight word of thee: but let it be nimble to reprove those, who shall offend thee, the preserver of men. O let it be a sword to them, who blaspheme that worthie name, by whicb I am call'd, and that most holie Spirit, which sanctifies and comforts me; those lims and children of Satan, who, O horror! doe with boldnes denie the Deitie of thy eternall Son and Spirit.</hi>

Yet the lyer and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembler doe abuse this prerogative, for, they shew men, by a false tongue, quite contrarie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages to those, which are drawne in their hearts. <hi>Let me O Lord, never imitate them, but let my words answer my knowledge, and manifest my thoughts, when it is fit they should be knowne; if not, let me conceale them by silence, and not disguise them by falshood.</hi>

And if I heare others offend in anie of these things, O my God, loose my tongue, and so open my mouth, that I shew them their sin, in such ouglie colors, that they both loath and forsweare it. Must I accuse that man, who doth blaspheme my King; and be dumbe before him, who doth revile my God? No, no; I neither must nor may.

               <p n="1">1 AFter a long and bloudie fight, how plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant is the victorie? I was assail'd on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie side: my senses had objects of sin, my heart felt motions of lewdnes, envie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, &amp;c. yet I did so bestirre my selfe, that my enemies are fled. <hi>O then, my God, receive my praise; for, thou alone hast taught my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Let Cesars trophies be pull'd downe, let
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55440:108"/> not Roman triumphs be regarded, before my glorious victorie. I have not skal'd hie walls, surpris'd strong townes, kill'd valiant men; yet I have done farre more: for, I have overcome my selfe, subdu'd my affections, tam'd my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious flesh. <hi>Then blessed be thou Lord, my strength, my hope and my fortres, who subduest my people, which by right should be under me, yet strives to master me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If those are strong, who overcome strong men; and those stronger, who conquer flesh and bloud; what strength is mine, since I have wrestled against principalities, against powers, against rulers of the darkenes of this world, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst spirituall wickednes in high places; yea so wrestled against them all, that they have had the fall? But who hath given me such strength, who hath girt my weak loines with truth, and armed my naked bodie with the brest-plate of righteousnes? <hi>None but thy selfe O Lord, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. Then none but thou shall have the praise of the victorie. I will not share in the triumph, I dare not challenge the trophie; but I doe render thee all honor and glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. God hath tempted me this day, by a losse in my goods, a disease in my flesh, a wound in my bodie; and I have with patience felt the smart of his rod, and without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring drunke in the cup of affliction. The
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:55440:109"/> flesh like Jobs curst wife would persuade me to curse my God; but I did rebuke her. Is not this a great victorie? <hi>Then my soule magnifies thee, Lord; and my spirit rejoices in thee, God my Saviour; because thou dost in me great things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In walking now abroad, I saw the world making a glorious shew, to draw me to his love: yet I past by, without regarding all his pomps, coveting his riches, desiring his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; for, I saw they were not lasting, but deceitfull, and often withdrawing from God. So I have overcome the world with a generous mind, which will love but perpetuall things. Is not my victorie famous? <hi>Then my soule gives thee thankes, O thou the maker of the world, because 'tis by thy grace, that I have escaped the corruption, which is in the world through lust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. The flesh hath this day tempted me by wantonnes, voluptie, sloth or gluttonie; and the devill by evill thoughts, ambition, malice, heresie; and I was almost woone, had not God by godlie notions shew'd me, the flesh will lead me unto death, and the devill drag me to hell. And so with that knowledge, I have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome both. <hi>O then let both my heart and flesh rejoice in thee my God; because thou hast kept me from sulfilling the lust of the flesh, and from the fierie darts of the wicked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. Men have tempted me by foule words, ill
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55440:109"/> deeds and unkindnes: yet I have done so well, that by faire meanes and kind usage I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased them, whereas I might by Satans sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion have given them as good, or rather as ill as they have brought me. So I have not been overcome of evill, but have overcome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill with good. And is not this a glorious vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie? No doubt it is. <hi>Therefore I must return thee glorious thankes, O God of love and peace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast indu'd me with meeknes, when wrath could have made my heart swell, and rage kindle the fire of immortall hatred.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. In the victorie of sin, vain-glorie is the last enemie, which resists: for, it takes strength from its fellowes defeat: therefore it must be kill'd by a sincere acknowledgement, that Gods hand, not our strength, hath overcome all our enemies. Then we must not be secure for the first victorie; since our enemies (Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us-like) seeme to get new forces by their fall, and daily assaile us againe, and will doe so till death. Then if we persevere in our spirituall warre, and valiantly overthrow sin, we shall receive the crowne laid up for those who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. <hi>O God, who seest the weaknes of nature, strengthen me by thy grace, that I fight a good fight, finish my course, and keep the faith.</hi>

               <head>His Overthrow in Sin, and Repentance for it.</head>
               <p n="1">1 AS it is glorious for a man, to overcome himselfe; so it is infamous, to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by himselfe: for, in that we vanquish sometimes, we see, we may doe it alwaies, were our hearts still the same, and our faith alike at all times. Then how disgracefull must it now be to me, since I am foyled by my selfe, whom before now I have often subdu'd? <hi>O God, I am asham'd; and could I find a place to hide my naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes from thine all-seeing eye, I would runne into it. But there is none, unles it be the bleeding wounds of thy deare Son Jesus. There I will be, beseeching thee, my sweet Saviour, to hide me well from the most dreadfull lookes of thy angrie Father, till thou hast made my peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Who made man, knows what is in man; yet he tries us often, not to know us better; but that others see what we are, and we our selves know our owne strength. He hath tempted me this morning, and brought my patience to her triall by a loss, pain, or fall: and I not remembring how long I have sweetly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd that thing, and what little right I had in it, more then those, who want it, have taken the losse of it, as a wrong done to me, repined
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:55440:110"/> at Gods providence, yea curs'd his name: a far greater losse then the first; yet in mercie he doth give me these good motions, to make me see my fault. <hi>Lord, I thanke thee for thy goodnes, beg pardon for my sin, and grace against such occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This day I saw the world in his Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks feathers, and I was so ravisht with that pompous shew, that I stood still to behold it, untill I was taken with both admiration and love. Then I perceiv'd, mine eyes were dim and weak to look heaven-ward, though cleere and strong to behold vanitie: yea I wonder how these thoughts come into my head, since my braines are so full of the things of this world. Doubtles they come from God, to call me back to him, and make me break my league with his and my sworne enemies. <hi>Lord, since thou call'st me, give me feet, my feet motion, my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion swiftnes, and my swiftnes acces to thee. Turn thy face from my present sin, and put out this misdeed, and let not such another shew make me commit the like offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>O God, give me the comfort of thy help again, and stablish me with thy free spirit: for lo, Satan hath put me downe, the Serpent hath beguiled me, and I have eat of the forbidden fruit. I have broken thy lawes by <gap reason="blank" extent="1+ words">

               </p>
               <p n="5">5. As the strength of our enemie commends our victorie; so his weaknes makes our over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw disgracefull. How infamous therefore is my present defeat; since by my flesh my sp'rit is overcome, a giant by a pygmie, and an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant by a flea? This base flesh in her fight with the spirit hath drawne it to fulfill her lust, in uncleannes, fornication, drunkennes, wrath, sloth or hatred, as easily as a great load-stone drawes a little needle. <hi>O Lord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me my faintnes, in yeelding to a foe so weake, and restore me what she hath ravished from me, that I may fight againe, and with thy help give her the foile.</hi>

               <p n="6">6. I have receiv'd a frowne, an angrie word, a little wrong, or a light blow from my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which in meeknes I might have borne; yet in my rage I have made a quarrell, at which God hath (no doubt) been much displeas'd with me. <hi>Therefore I humble now my soule, and beg mercie of thee, O God, the Father of mercie. O save me for thy mercies sake, from my sins past, and prevent the future.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. O that mine eyes could see the ouglie shape of sin, that so I should loath it! O that I could well consider, that sin hath made hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,

Why have I ly'd, sworne, cheated, stolne, or fought; since by such things I lose Gods grace, and draw his curse upon my head? <hi>Most glorious God, I have in that done as a man shapen in wickednes, and conceived in sin: but doe thou as a God, rich in mercie, abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and truth, and forgiving iniquitie and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression and sin. Have mercie upon me O God after thy great goodnes; and according to the multitude of thy mercie wash away my grievous offence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Repentance is a salve for the wounds of the soule, a remedie for her diseases, and the very key of heaven: a Jewell too precious to be in mans keeping. It is a gift of God, as all other good things: therefore we should not so sleight it, as to deferre it untill death; for then we may misse it. This very houre is my best time for repentance: the next may be not mine, or if it be, yet my repentance may be gone. It is a sorrow for sins past, and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of amendment. Can I have the first when I will; and use the second, when I die? No, no, my soule. To grieve heartily for thy sins, not onely because thou fear'st punishment; but rather out of love towards thy gracious God,

Not an Inheritance gotten hastily, because its end shall not be blest, but who swallowes riches, shall vomit them againe. Not an Inheritance acquired by injustice: for, treasures of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes profit nothing, and such riches make themselves wings; or are kept for the owners hurt.

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55440:123"/> and Submission. If then I Know my God aright, and him, whom he hath sent; Know him after divine revelation, not human imagination. If I truly Beleeve in him, Relie wholly on his mercie and the merits of Christ, for preservation, donation, salvation; preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of sin and harme, donation of good things, salvation of my whole person, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he hath promis'd, and not alwaies as I expect. If I Love him sincerely, not according to his infinit merit, but to my best capacitie, above my selfe and all things else. If I Feare him, trembling at the thought of my lest of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences 'gainst him, not so much because he can punish me, as because I'le not be ingrat for his loving favors. If I yeeld him the best Service I can, as to my best Master, neglecting all things to please him; yet not serving after mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, but according unto his prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. If I am, as neere as I can, Conforme to the image of his Son, in righteousnes and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. If I Submit my will to his, as well to drink the bitter cup of affliction, as to savour the sweetnes of consolations; cleaving closely to him in prosperitie and adversitie, I may say with exces of joy, I am in Christ, and Christ in me. <hi>If my corruption hinders me yet to say this, O God, pitie thy poore creature, and renew me with speed. But if thy grace hath alreadie been so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:55440:123"/> in me, as to blesse me with that Knowledge, Faith, Love, Feare, Service, Conformitie and Submission; O Lord, receive my thankes, and heare my pray'rs: thankes for thy past favors, and pray'rs for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of them. Thou art a God excessive in love, excellent in mercie, abundant in goodnes. In these thou hast begun thy gracious workes in me. O then continue them, and daily perfect them: and let me now take a sweet rest, in the assurance of thy love, and protection of thy power.</hi>

               <head>His Night-feares.</head>
               <p n="1">1 NIght is nothing, but th' absence of the Sun; and darknes, but the privation of light: yet when night comes, it brings with it a kind of feare; not to wild beasts, for then they walk to seek their prey; but unto man, whose conscience is guiltie of manie grievous sins, which come best to his mind, when he's alone and in the dark. <hi>Lord, forgive mine, and free my heart from present feares.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The night is more quiet, then the day: and yet we feare in it what we doe not regard by day. A Mouse running, a Board cracking, a dog howling, an Owle scritching put us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a cold sweat. What is the cause of it? Sin committed by light. When the Sun shines, and we are with our friends, we drink
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:55440:124"/> iniquitie like a sugred portion, delighted with the present sweetnes of sin; but not fearing its future bitternes. But when night hath drawn her black vaile, and we are about to take rest; then the potion begins to work, and puts us into distemper. <hi>O Lord, whilst mine eyes see the Sun, let my mind behold thee; and whilst I am with my fellowes, let my heart talk with thee, never think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my selfe secure enough, to displease thee, in the lest thing. So shall not my soule be afraid for the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by night, nor for the pestilence, which walketh in darknes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Doe we feare more by night, then by day, because Satan is call'd the Ruler of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? Then we mistake S<seg rend="sup">t</seg> Pauls meaning: for he beleeved not, that Satan had power to rule over outward darknes, by bringing or remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving light: but he calls him Ruler of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this world, to shew his pow'r over worldlings, whose understanding being dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they are alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance and blindnes of their hearts. Against such children of darknes Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan beares a great sway both night and day: but he can doe no harme to the children of light, either by day or night, unles God gives him leave. <hi>Let me, O Lord, never feare him, but make me strong to resist his assaults; and grant, I trust under thy wings, and abide under thy shadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:55440:124"/>4. As man is man, he may well feare; but as he's Christian, he should not: for, he must know, that nothing can happen to him, but what his God ordaines. Now if he hath a true feeling of Gods love to him-ward, he shall beleeve, the Lord will look to him, as a carefull mother to her beloved child. <hi>Lord, let me feare to offend thee, then live secure from all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie harmes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Who keeps me, slumbers not, and who made me will suffer nothing to marre me, but for his glorie and my good: yet I grow sad at this conceit, start at this noise, and shiver at this sight: because (doubtles) I see not, how neere me the Lord is. Had I some light, and were my friends by me, I should but smile at this, which makes my whole bodie tremble. But O blind heart! is not God more pow'r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then man, and faith brighter then anie outward light? <hi>O God, quicken my faith, that I trust in thee as I ought, and remove now from me the present cause of feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. 'Tis said, Lions lose their courage, if some thing be cast on their eyes: and so manie men doe, when they are in darknes. A strong token of their spirituall blindnes: for, he's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly blind, who feares mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> he sees not, that God is at all times alike pow'rfull, to protect his servants.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:55440:125"/> Then this likewise figures, that when sin (the soules night) hath spread over her its darknes, she is seised with great terrors. <hi>Keep me, good Lord, from all blindnes of heart, and darknes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; that though my outward eyes be shut, or deprived of light; yet I want neither faith in thy providence, nor knowledge of thy mysteries, and of mine owne dutie. Keep me also (I beseech thee) from Satans illusions, fearfull visions, assaults of men, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturne feares and all harme.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Our nightlie dreames follow often our daylie affections and occupations. As these are, those shall be. The covetous tels in his sleep his coine, finds a treasure, increases his riches, or loses of his store. The voluptuous dreams of his cheere and whores; the angrie man, of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and fightings; the cheater, of tricks and deceits; the ambitious, of new honors.

               <p n="3">3. I am often troubled by dreames of losse, danger and death, either of my selfe or my friends. And contrariwise I thinke sometimes in sleep of riches, honors and mariage; yea I doe often foresee things: but there is no trust in such dreames, unles they come to us by Gods revelation. Yet we may from them take warning, to looke better unto our selves, friends, goods, least that through negligence happen, of which we dream'd. <hi>Lord, give me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>GOod being communicative, and thou, O God, the soverain good, it pleased thee, to manifest thy love, wisdome and pow'r, in the creation of all things. And because the light is a meane, to see and discerne corporall objects, this light was the first of thy distinct workes: that so man the last to be made might see what thou hadst created for him, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise learne, that light must precede his actions, yea guide him in all his cogitations and affections. So
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55440:130"/> when the worke of our Redemption was finisht, thou, O Father, didst raise thy Son, the Sun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that by the beames of his glorie, Christians should see and beleeve it. That Light and this Sun appear'd first this day, which for that cause is the first in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in our religion. It is then a great day, it is<note n="*" place="margin">See my Catechisme to the 4. Commandement.</note> a holie day, if not in it selfe, yet to me. I will make it holie, by making my selfe such. But, O my God, this speech is presumptuous: for, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines is thine. It proceeds from thee, and returnes to thee. Thou, thou onelie establishest mans heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blamable in holines. Thee then onely I beseech to make me holie. Sanctifie all my thoughts, affections, words, actions. Help me to withdraw the two first from my worldlie affaires, and fix them upon thee, the glorious Maker of the world, and gracious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of man: then let my words be of thee and to thee, and my workes holie before thee. O let my thoughts be drownd in thee, who art so mightie in wonders, yea wonders wrought for me. Let my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be wholy on thee, for the exces of thy Christ in my Redemption. Great Creator, I praise thee in thy noble workes. Gracious Saviour, I will sing thy excessive love, thy tender compassions. Mightie Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, I submit my person to thee, by whom I have been made, and manie things for me. Here I vow thee a perpetuall service; and here, most loving God, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thee a pure, intire and constant love, or at lest, a desire of such. I desire to love thee purely, intirely,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55440:130"/> constantly, and therefore beg of thee the sweet effect of my desire. As thou hast been my onelie Creator and Redeemer, be thou my onelie Love; Let me love none but thee, or none but for thee and in thee. Let my holie actions, religious words manifest the sinceritie of my love towards thee, walking this day, yea all my life, as a child of the day, a child of light, made by thee and for thee, the wise Maker of this visible light, and mightie Raiser of Christ from the dead: to whom with thee and the most holie Spirit, one omnipotent Creator and mercifull Saviour, be service and glorie, by me and all thy workes of Creation and Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. <hi>Amen.</hi>

If all this peoples minds wander as much as mine, this man may well direct his speech unto these stones: for indeed in preaching unto us in our distractions, he speakes to none better then stones; since we receive his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions no more then these pillars. So our hearts are stonie, in which the good seed of Gods word can take no root at all. <hi>Then, Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech thee, to take away my stonie heart, and give me one of flesh, easie to be till'd by thy labourers, soft to receive the seed, and fat to yeeld increase.</hi>

               <head>Considerations upon the Minister and his Sermon.</head>
               <p>If anie of Christs Ministers be such as those, I commend here, let him glorie and rejoyce in the Lord: but if he be guiltie of anie of those faults, which I censure, let him studie a correction of his imperfections, and love me for telling the truth. This truth I love, and doe gladly manifest it on all just occasions; and God forbid, his peculiar servants should hate me for my paines.</p>
               <p n="1">1 THis man speaks verie well. He hath a good and fluent tongue, and (which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55440:135"/> his hands are as good, as his tongue. He is a man who preaches as he lives. He's none of those who lay heavie burdens on mens shoulders, which they themselves will not move with one of their fingers: but like Jesus the Son of God, he does, and teaches what is needfull for himselfe and others. By his good works, he makes his calling and election sure; and by his godlie instructions, he shewes his flock the way to happines. <hi>Blest be the Lord, in the gifts of this his servant, and let his goodnes send manie such labourers into his great harvest.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This is an honest man: yet his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is either small, or he wants expression. His life is holie and blameles, but his wit's somewhat slow, and his utterance unpleasant. Yet if he say more, then I practise daily; if his doctrine be sound, and his counsels whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, what have I to doe with the rest? He's not there, to tickle my eares, but to convert my soule. <hi>O God! let me not seeke in thy servants, the inticing speech of mans wisdome, but the plaine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of the Spirit and of pow'r.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This is a man, who with curious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, choice words and strong reasons could persuade anie thing, were not his deeds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his words: but who will beleeve him preaching sobrietie, when he's seldome sober; exhorting others to mildnes, being a severe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55440:135"/> man; teaching frugalitie, whilst he's lavish; bountie, being a wretch; or plaine dealing, when he deceives others, and owes more then he can render? Who by his persuasions can live quietly with his neighbours, since he's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies at strife with his Parishioners, for things of no moment? Who? All may, and I will. As long as his doctrine is Christian, and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels morall, we have Christs owne warrant to obey him. I will doe what he bids, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare what he does. Shall not then souldiers fight, because drummers fight not, but invite them to the combat: or shall I lie down in the road, or go back to my house; because he, who shewes me the way, goes not along with me? He goes perhaps another way, or he's not yet readie to begin his journie. <hi>Let, O good God, my soule shun the ill examples, and follow the godlie counsels of such men as I heare, this is: and if it be thy blessed will, Lord, make him see the errors of his life, and convert him to another; but let not his ill courses draw me from pietie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Minister is out, his memorie hath deceiv'd him, some wandering thought hath made him lose his place. <hi>Help him, O God, least hame put him out more and more, and anie man thinke him the worse, for what happens sometimes to verie learned men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This man reads his Sermon; which thing
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55440:136"/> manie dislike, yet 'tis nothing to them. For my part I care not, whether his eyes be on his book, or on anie thing else. They are nothing to me. His tongue is the lim, I observe, and I weigh his words, not his lookes. Yet if his reading doth proceed from sloath, not from want of time, or weaknes of memorie, <hi>make him, O Lord, more painfull in divine studies, and more carefull to please his flocke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. Some think, this man preaches not his owne words, but that he steales other mens inventions. If he doth so, what's that to me, as long as he preaches good things? I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps obliged to him, for his theft; since belike his conceits and sermons should not be so good, as those, he borrowes. <hi>Lord, let nothing hinder my profit under him, or such as he's: and if be take other mens workes for need, give him a copious wit; and if for sloath, give him that diligence, which his calling requires.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. This speech is for that man: there the Minister hath him right. Doth he not blush at this? Nay rather, he might blush or laugh at my folie, if he should know my present thoughts: for, do I know the Preachers mind, and am I to judge that person? <hi>No, no, my God, pardon me therefore my rashnes, and if that man is guiltie of the thing, of which the Preacher speakes, let him now bewaile it, and ever after forbeare it: and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55440:136"/> as for me, Lord, keep me from the like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. This is for me: my conscience is guiltie of this. <hi>O then good God, give me sorrow for what is past, and fortitude against all future occasions of displeasing thee in this thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. How thin is this Congregation? Yet the Parish is large and full enough. Is it then the Ministers fault? Is he careles or incapable to feed his flock? Or are his sheep wearie of their pasture, though good, and of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, although Orthodox? If either of these be the cause, <hi>remove it, Lord, I beseech thee, either gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving abilitie and diligence to the Shepherd, or if he hath these alreadie, making his flock adhere to him, and forsake strange and false teachers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. How full this Temple is! Yea what throng at the doores; and climbing up at the windowes! Is it because the Preacher is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man in true learning and pietie? or that these will not endure the sound doctrine of their Pastors, but after their owne lusts, heap to themselves teachers, which please their itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eares with new doctrines or lights, fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous inventions, damnable heresies, and devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish blasphemies? <hi>If the first cause drawes together this auditorie, let, O Lord, this man be still well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, or indue all other Pastors with the same gifts. But if he be one of these last teachers, and these hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers such, as turne their eares from the truth unto fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55440:137"/> recall them, O God, I pray thee, recall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them againe to the love of forsaken truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. This man hath a low voice, or will not set it out, and so is he not fit for this great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblie; to manie of which he preaches in vaine: sith they cannot heare distinctly his words. In this case may be well allow'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutations of Benefices. Howsoever, I judge that man guiltie of presumption, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great necessitie undertakes an office, he cannot well discharge, either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, negligence or weaknes. And I esteem those men careles of their soules food, who with an ungodlie patience will gape two houres on a silent Preacher, if they can find one, who speakes out the words of truth and pietie with zeale. <hi>Let me, O Lord, be none of these careles hearers, and let no more low voic'd Teachers intrude themselves into such large bodies, ample con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations; but be confin'd into places of lesse capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, where their words be not lost, their discourses fruitles, by the defect of a strong voice, or of pure zeale to put it forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12. How high and profound is this man? Who can dive into his matters, soare after his loftie language? Pietie may have a fine dresse, Divinitie may be adorn'd, but not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd, that it be not knowne. He preaches himselfe, and not Christ, who speakes above
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:55440:137"/> the ordinarie capacitie of his Christian audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie. There are too manie such Preachers, <hi>and that there be none, vouchsafe, gracious God, to shew the vanitie of all things without thee, even to those, who ought to preach downe vanitie, and teach selfe-deniall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. What strange faces doth this man make, and what ridiculous postures hath he? Is he in travell of the truth, and so in sorrow, till she be brought forth? But such faire Child should not be usher'd by anticks. These indecent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures disgrace such noble birth. <hi>Let this man know so much, O Lord, and so compose his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to the gravitie of his profession, holines of his vocation, that his unseemlie behaviour hinder not his spectators to be attentive to the sound doctrine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14. This man is mov'd, and moves: he speakes with zeale, and so kindles a divine fire in the hearts of his auditorie, suiting his voice and his modest postures to the matters, of which he speakes. Heare, how loud he thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders against infidelitie and sin! how highly he commends faith and good workes! How lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly and earnestly he exhorts and rebukes! <hi>Let not, Lord, his strength faile, but make his lungs as good as his heart is, and give the like good hearts and lungs to all our Ministers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. How cold this Preacher is, or seemes to be! Ought the quick &amp; pow'rfull word of God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55440:138"/> to be so coldly deliv'red? <hi>Shew him, my Lord, that it must not be so. When yet 'tis so, let me not take it so, but receive it with joy and savour of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16. This is an excellent doctrine, a wittie and pious observation, a sweet application. <hi>Lord, let me not lose it, but print it in my heart, and so likewise in all the rest of this congregation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="17">17. Some say, this man walkes in craftines, and handles the word of God deceitfully, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the time, and respecting persons. I must then heare him warily, and wisely examine whatsoever he sayes. <hi>My God, let all the rest doe so: and if this man be such, make him walke and speak in sinceritie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. What's this? An error, heresie or bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemie, if I be not deceiv'd. <hi>O my God, stop that mouth, or let it recant these false words: or at lest, let them be all lost, not receiv'd or beleev'd by us; and suffer not, thy pure word be corrupt, thy holie word blasphem'd by its owne Ministers, thy truth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clips'd by those, who should manifest it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. The Proverb, Short and sweet, is now true in this man. He hath in few and sweet words delivered manie pious matters for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, exhortation, dissuasion, consolation, condemnation. <hi>Lord, I praise thee in him, and pray thee to send manie such, for the good of thy Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20. How willing is the people to goe out,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55440:138"/> and how manie sleeping and yawning persons this Preacher hath made with his long prayers &amp; tedious Sermon! I wish, that both he &amp; all such would consider, that Sermons and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are not esteem'd good by their length, but that rather they lose often their grace and fruit by it, and their maker his thankes. <hi>Yet, Lord, let not my devotion be cool'd by long actions of religion, nor thy ambassadors marre their message by vaine repetitions, confounding, for their ease, the memorie of their hearers, by neglected method and careles expressions; or dulling their spirits by their prolixitie.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>THose, who will goe to the Lords Table, must have Faith 'bove all things; that when they take the bread and wine, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, there's bodie and bloud; and when they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55440:150"/> eat the sacrament, they conceive the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Faith is well call'd the evidence of things, which are not seen: for, by it we see Christ, whilst our eyes view the elements; and by it we touch his bodie, whilst our sences feele and tast bread and wine. With faith the sacrament is an antidote 'gainst poison, and without faith 'tis strong venom: for he, who beleeves, Christ is there off'ring unto out soules the merits of his bodie and bloud bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and shed for them, may be assur'd of the pardon of his past sins, and receives strength 'gainst the future; whereas unbeleevers take the shell without the kernell, the bread with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Lord, and the signe of Christ without Christ: or if they find him there, 'tis as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to infect them; not as wholesome meat, to feed them; 'tis as a Judge, to condemne them; not as a Saviour, to save them. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then, my soule, whether thou hast an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire faith of Christian mysteries, revealed to the Church, and contained in the Scripture, and namely about the sacrament of Christs bodie and bloud. If thou hast it, thank God for it; if thou wantst it, desire it thus from him. <hi>O thou great God, whose nature is above our reach, &amp; whose secret operations no human reason can conceive! give me that faith, without which no man can know thee, without which no soule can please thee.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55440:150"/> Lord, I beleeve; but that I beleeve unto righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, O God, increase my faith. Concerning the great sacrament of thy flesh and bloud, I beleeve, that in the night that thou, Lord Jesus, wast betray'd, thou didst give thy disciples bread and wine, which then thou didst call thy bodie and bloud, with charge to eat and drinke, and doe the same in remembrance of thee. For, as thou wast upon thy departure, thou wouldst leave us a signe of thy bodie, a figure of thy bloud, a memoriall of thy passion; least we should forget thee, who for our sakes wast readie to lay downe thy life. Therefore I take those elements of bread and wine, for holie signes of thy bodie and bloud, beleeving, that though they remaine after the consecration in their substance both bread and wine, yet they are more then common bread and wine, being made by prayer and thy word, the figures of thy flesh and bloud, which in the action and use of the sacrament are really and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually taken by the faithfull. So though I see, feele and tast bread and wine; yet I beleeve to eat thy flesh and drinke thy bloud, in a spirituall sort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, thou didst die for me, and by faith and the operation of thy Spirit, applying to my soul the merit of thy death. O Lord, let me live in this faith: O Lord, let me die in this faith. So shall my soule live after death; for, who eates thee, can never die: now we eat thee by faith: therefore, my God, confirme my faith; my Christ, pray that my faith faile not, either concerning this, or anie other point of holie mysteries.</hi>

Let me not set my affections upon that, which is not, for riches passe away from one to the other, breeding care in their stay, and sorrow in their departure.

Give me a strong appetite of that heavenly meat, of that angelicall bread, that bread of life, which comes downe from heaven; that I eat well of it, and so live for ever.

And this is daily done, when God feeds us with good notions, either by the Scripture, godlie bookes, and Sermons; or by speciall motions proceeding immediatly from the holie Ghost; but this is chiefly done in the most blessed sacrament of Christs bodie &amp; bloud; for, there it is, that he gives us a full banquet of spirituall comforts, by imparting us the merits, his Son purchast for us, by a most cruell death. This communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the meat of our soules, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our Saviours satisfaction is the

This expression hath more energie, then the first, and is more acceptable both unto God and man. Since then my God hath vouchsafed me a favor, which deserves (though it surmounts) all thankfulnes, I will not rest in those poore verball thankes, I have presented him; but I will also strive, that my faithfull service confirme my gratitude, and manifest my love.</hi> But that my will never want good succes, I beg of thee, O immutable God, stabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in my resolutions; that my affections and actions, thoughts and words, soule and bodie be, from this day till death, as manie crystall glasses, through which all men may see, that I am thy thankfull servant. I will, that my understanding be soberly busie about thy knowledge; my memorie keep fast thy noble acts and statutes; my will desire thy favor, and be subject to thine; my heart love thee, and my intrals rejoyce in thee. I will also, that my eyes wait on thee, and view thy majestie in thy wondrous creatures; my eares be open to thy word; my tongue nimble to tell thy praise;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55440:164"/> my hands lift up unto thy commandements; my feet swift to run in thy wayes. In a word, I will, my whole person be thine, to serve thee in holines and righteousnes, all the dayes of my life. And therefore I doe now consecrate it to thee, O God the Father, who hast given me thy Son: to thee, O God the Son, who hast laid downe thy life for me: to thee, O God the holie Ghost, by whose gracious operation I have been fed with my Saviours bodie and bloud.

                  <hi>THe Jewish Sacraments being indeed the same as ours, the punishments of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse must be our example. If therefore manie of them (which did eat the signes of that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meat figur'd to them under Manna and Water, and to us under Bread and Wine) were overthrowne in the wildernes, for their lust after evill things, idolatrie, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

O rather let me die, before I offend my good God, whose mightie hand hath formed me, whose precious bloud hath redeem'd me, and whose holie Spirit gives me these good motions.</hi> Shall I, my Lord, drink thy sweet cup of blessing, and the bitter cup of cursing, which the Devill will present me? Shall I take the tokens of thine infinit love, then provoke thee unto anger, by giving my selfe unto sin? Shall I make my bodie, which is one of thy members by sanctification, the member of a harlot by fornication; or whereas 'tis by right the temple of thy holie Spirit, and a schoole of vertue, shall I make it a palace for Satan, and a sink of all vice? O rather let my God take up my soule to him. Even so come Lord Jesus, come quickly (I beseech thee) for my death, either in the world, or to sin. Let this be the last houre of my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall life, or the first of a spirituall. O let not sin reigne more in my bodie; but renew within me a right and constant spirit, which look well to his wayes, and walke aright in thine, never offending thee willingly, but in all things seeking how to please thee my merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God and Saviour. So shall I expect thy glorie, through the merits of thy passion, and relying on thy mercie feare not the damnation allotted unto them, which eat and drink unworthily the Sacrament of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and the pledges of salvation.</p>

                  <hi>IF God did chuse under the Law those beasts for sacrifice, which did ruminate or chew the cud, it was (I think) to shew, that he sets his heart on those men, who when they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd anie favor of him, revolve it often in their minds.

Let me seriously consider what out of love thou didst once suffer for my sins; and thereupon make my heart yeeld thee love for love, and conceive a loathing of sin, the murtherer of my Saviour. Let me studie these two lessons, to love thee, who lov'st me; and hate sin, which kill'd me and thee. And that I
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55440:166"/> learne them perfectly, be thou, wise God, my Schoole-master.

As we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider their inhumanitie, in laying their cruell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; so we must acknowledge thy goodnes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing the same; for, we can not denie, that our Land was then (and is still now) full of manie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and guiltie of great sins, which deserved great punishments: yet thou wouldst not then put the rod into the hands of our enemies; for thou dost desire but our correction, and they did seeke our destruction. Then let all thy people praise thee now; and let ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Kings, Nobles and Commons forget thy compassions, in our wonderfull deliv'rance: but let them rejoyce on this day, and from this day to the worlds end, professe sincerely that holie religion, which the Devils would abolish; and love that God, who maintaines his Gospel, and protects his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe chiefe men of our Land are now ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, as so manie sweet smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling flow'rs, to be made up in a pleasant nose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay.</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55440:186"/> Therefore I beseech thee, O thou most skilfull Gardiner, who hast dispos'd all the Nations under the Sun, as so manie severall knots of thy curious Garden, to set these flow'rs of our Kingdome in a decent order, and bind them up with the strong thread of charitie. And as sweet Roses have sharp pricks, so that they may as well draw bloud from the veines, as recreate the braines; so let those men even now doe the same; pricke the wicked by sharp statutes, and comfort the godlie by the sweet odor of good lawes. Poure thy wisdome into their minds, and thy goodnes into their hearts; that first they see and love, then enact that, which may conduce to thy glorie and our generall good. O make them wise in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, religious in their intentions, impartiall in their judgements, upright in their sentences, and courage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their pious resolutions. Let neither love nor hate, hope nor feare make them swerve from that way, they shall once know, may lead from vice unto vertue, from error unto truth, from mens traditions to thy word, from the Devill to thee: but strengthen them, O God, by the serious consideration, that the cause being thine, happie are those, who lose their lives, to maintaine it. Yet, Lord, have speciall care of their persons, on whose safetie our present happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes doth mediatly depend. O watch about, above and under them, that no harme befall them. Let thine eyes search where theirs can not, and thy wisdome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55440:186"/> what theirs can not prevent. Let not the man of bloud have power to shed theirs: but as thou hast heretofore shew'd thy loving care, in the wonderfull deliv'rance of such great assemblie from an infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall plot; so continue, gracious Father, thy blessings upon them and us, in their preservation. Heare me, my God, heare me for thy Sons sake, and even now say <hi>Amen</hi> to these my desires.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>WHen in mind I behold the state of this Kingdome, I compare it to the glorious heavens adorn'd with their bright lights. The King is like the Sun, the Queen the Moone, our great men the other Planets, and our Commons the Stars. Then from this conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration my mind flies up, before the throne of grace, and speakes to my God in this wise.</hi> Thou most high God, who by thy power and wisdome hast made all things, in subordination one unto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, let that be done among these men, which we observe, in the faire lights of thy heavens. They all receive their splendor from the Sun, and this all his from thee. So let our glorious King take all his light from thee, then impart it to his deare Queen, his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peers and honorable Commons. Inform his mind with such knowledge, indue his heart with such good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55440:187"/> and his will with such equitie and justice, that none of these inferior bodies need borrow other light for the rule of the Church and State; then that, which he may cast on them. Let thy word be his guide, thy law his exercice, thy glorie his studie, thy true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion his first aime, his salvation the next, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good the third; the fourth and last, his oppressed friends deliv'rance, and his courteous neighbours friendship. Then let his subjects hearts conceive such affection towards a Prince so good and wise, that they all strive to bring his designes to effect, his en'mies to his feet, their goods and lives to his service, and the preservation of his sacred Person. And in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes unto thee, for the gift of such a vertuous, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and gracious Monarch, make them willing, and withall able to forsake their ill wayes, and turne to thee with all their hearts, living henceforth after thy holie will, and now making, or reviving such lawes, as root out vice and plant vertue, depresse falshood and exalt truth, settle our peace, and make thy Church flourish. And when both King and people are by thy help thus affected towards thee, and one towards the other, then let thy heart accept their indeavors, and crowne them with happie succes; thine eyes behold their want, and turne it to plentie, both of grace and worldlie riches, and thy hands strengthen their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes 'gainst all opposition of either man or Devill. O Lord! be among them, to order their consultations;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55440:187"/> and about them, to preserve their persons; that the issue of this Convocation be such, as holie men expect, both for thy glorie and their good. So shall my soule rejoyce in thy goodnes, my lips praise thy greatnes, my whole man serve thy majestie in peace.</p>

                  <hi>LOng life is a blessing, which all men doe naturally desire, chiefly when wealth, health, ease and pleasure wait on it. Adde un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these a good conscience, then earth is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heaven, where good men have a fore-relish of those infinit joyes, they expect after death. Yet as earth is but earth; so we must look for crosse in happines, for losse in wealth, for sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in pleasure, for death in life. Happie is he, who enjoyes sweet things with wisdome, eats honie with sobrietie; and when he must tast gall, does it with such grace, that his sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack rise not at it. I am not such, as may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this happines; for I have (like a bad scholar) trifled away my time: yea these twelve months, which God hath granted me, to learne wisdome, and studie godlines, have been foolishly spent, in vanitie and sin: which considering now,</hi> I thanke thee, gracious Lord, for the addition of this yeare unto thy servants life,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:55440:188"/> and beg pardon of thee, for my manifold omissions and commissions of what thy Law bids and forbids. Forgive, O God, my sinfull thoughts, idle words, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just workes. Forgive my propension to vice, and my aversion from vertue. Forgive my wilfulnes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting thy good motions; mine oblivion of those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I owe both thee and men, and my losse of that time, thou hast granted for repentance. If it be thy pleasure, Lord, grant me more, and withall grace, to make the best of it. O let me consider, there is here nothing more precious; and therefore, Lord, let me not abuse it, least I repent too late, and desire more, when no more shall be giv'n. If thou wilt number the next yeare 'mongst the dayes of my life, &amp; thou be pleas'd, to make it prosperous; then make me also wise, least felicitie deceive me. But if thou hast ordain'd, to make me drinke with thee the bitter cup of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; then, Lord, grant me patience, least I faint in adversitie. Whether my life be sweet or soure, O God, make it holie, and my selfe thankfull unto thee, for all thy favors towards me. But if the time drawes neere, in which my soule must leave this earthlie part, this bodie of death: O then, my God, as the stones motion is quicker, when 'tis neerer the ground; so let my soule redouble all her affections towards thee her Maker; and by love and service, make hast to thee, the center of her happines.</p>
